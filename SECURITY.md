## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities. Please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to us via one of the following methods:

1. **Email:** Send details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories:** Use the "Security" tab in this repository
3. **Encrypted Communication:** Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description:** A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact:** Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction:** Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions:** Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix:** If you have suggestions for fixing the vulnerability
- **Discovery Credit:** How you'd like to be credited (if at all)

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment:** We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Initial Assessment:** We'll provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
3. **Investigation:** We'll investigate and work on a fix
4. **Coordination:** We'll coordinate with you on disclosure timing
5. **Release:** We'll release a security update and advisory
6. **Recognition:** We'll acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

### Expected Timeline

- **24 hours:** Acknowledgment of report
- **72 hours:** Initial vulnerability assessment
- **7 days:** Regular updates on progress
- **30 days:** Target for security fix release (may vary based on complexity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying Grocery POS, please follow these security recommendations:

#### Environment Security
- **Change default credentials:** Update the default Manager PIN
- **Use strong encryption keys:** Generate secure backup encryption keys
- **Secure environment variables:** Protect `.env` files and never commit them
- **Regular updates:** Keep the application and dependencies updated

#### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS:** Deploy with TLS/SSL certificates in production
- **Firewall configuration:** Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **VPN access:** Consider VPN for remote access to the system
- **Network segmentation:** Isolate POS systems from general network

#### Data Security
- **Regular backups:** Enable and test backup systems regularly
- **Backup encryption:** Always use encryption for backup files
- **Access controls:** Implement proper user access controls
- **Audit logging:** Enable and monitor audit logs

#### System Security
- **Container security:** Use non-root users in Docker containers
- **File permissions:** Set appropriate file system permissions
- **Security headers:** Ensure security headers are properly configured
- **Input validation:** Validate all user inputs

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention:** Use parameterized queries
- **XSS prevention:** Escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **Authentication:** Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization:** Enforce proper access controls

#### Development Practices
- **Dependency scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static analysis:** Use static code analysis tools
- **Security testing:** Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Code review:** Review all code changes for security issues

#### Build and Deployment
- **Secure builds:** Use secure build environments
- **Image scanning:** Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets management:** Never hardcode secrets in code
- **Environment separation:** Separate development, staging, and production

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

1. **Content Security Policy:** Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
2. **Input Validation:** Client and server-side input validation
3. **Encryption:** AES-256 encryption for backup files
4. **Secure Headers:** Security headers configured in Nginx
5. **Access Controls:** Manager PIN protection for sensitive operations

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Local Storage:** Application uses local storage for data persistence
2. **Client-Side Security:** Being a client-side application, some security relies on the deployment environment
3. **Network Security:** HTTPS and network security depend on deployment configuration
4. **Physical Security:** POS terminals should be physically secured

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to security reports in a timely manner
- We will work with researchers to understand and address issues
- We will provide credit to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- We will maintain transparency while protecting users

### Researcher Guidelines

- **Responsible Disclosure:** Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- **Scope:** Focus on the Grocery POS application and its direct dependencies
- **Testing:** Use only test environments and data
- **Privacy:** Do not access or modify user data
- **Disruption:** Avoid actions that could disrupt service for others

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks on hardware
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues in third-party services not directly controlled by us
- Issues requiring physical access to the POS terminal
- Attacks requiring user interaction with malicious content

## Security Updates

### Update Notifications

Security updates will be communicated through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes in CHANGELOG.md
- Email notifications (if subscribed)
- Security mailing list (if available)

### Update Process

1. **Assessment:** Evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Development:** Develop and test the security fix
3. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the fix
4. **Release:** Release the security update
5. **Notification:** Notify users and provide upgrade instructions

### Severity Levels

- **Critical:** Immediate threat requiring urgent action
- **High:** Significant security risk requiring prompt action
- **Medium:** Moderate security risk requiring timely action
- **Low:** Minor security improvement
