# Comprehensive POS System Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all the major fixes and enhancements made to the POS system as requested by the expert product owner.

## 1. Discount Rules - Retail Price Only ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `src/services/discountEngine.ts`
  - Modified `applyRulesToCart()` to calculate discounts based on retail price only
  - Added `retail_price` field to cart lines for discount calculations
  - Updated discount calculations to use `retailPrice` instead of `unit_price` for percentage discounts
  - Ensured fixed amount discounts are also capped by retail price total

- **File**: `src/services/posService.ts`
  - Updated `applyRuleCaps()` to fetch product data and use retail price for discount calculations
  - Added comments clarifying that discounts are calculated on retail price

### Impact:
- All discounts (percentage and fixed amount) now apply only to retail price
- Wholesale, credit, and other price tiers maintain their pricing without affecting discount calculations
- Consistent discount application across all price tiers

## 2. Manual Discount in Cart ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `src/pages/Sales.tsx`
  - Added `manualDiscount` state with amount and type (amount/percent)

- **Clear Button**: Quick reset to zero
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue color coding for manual discount

### Impact:

  - Created `parseReceiptNumber()` for converting back to date
  - Created `formatReceiptNumber()` for display formatting

- **File**: `src/pages/Sales.tsx`
  - Imported receipt number generator

### Benefits:
- Unique identifier for each transaction
- Chronological sorting capability
- Easy date extraction from receipt number
- 14-digit number that fits standard systems

## 5. Print Receipt Fix ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Issue:
After payment processing updates, print receipt function was not working because:
- Cart was cleared before printing
- Sale data wasn't properly captured

### Changes Made:

  - Simplified `handlePrintReceipt()` function
  - Removed dependency on `activeSale` from POS service
  - Direct cart access for printing

### Impact:
- Print receipt now works correctly after payment updates
- Receipt shows accurate totals including manual discount
- Receipt number is displayed
- Clean workflow: Payment → Print → Clear

## 6. Manual Discount Integration

### Total Calculations:
```typescript
getSaleTotals() {
  const gross = cartLines total
  const lineDiscounts = sum of all item discounts
  const manualDiscountAmount = calculated from manual discount
  const totalDiscount = lineDiscounts + manualDiscountAmount
  const net = gross - totalDiscount + tax
  
  return {
    gross,
    discount: totalDiscount,
    lineDiscounts,
    manualDiscount: manualDiscountAmount,
    tax,
    net
  }
}
```

### Display:
- **Gross**: Total before any discounts
- **Item Savings**: Automatic rule-based discounts
- **Manual Discount**: Operator-applied discount
- **Tax**: Calculated tax amount
- **Net Total**: Final amount to pay
