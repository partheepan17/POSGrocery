# UI Fixes - Screenshot Issues Resolved

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Time Not Updating Dynamically** ✅

**Problem**: The time display was not updating in real-time on the Sales page.

**Root Cause**: The time update interval was not properly set up or was being cleared prematurely.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added a dedicated `useEffect` hook specifically for time updates
- Ensured the time interval runs independently of other effects
- Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added dedicated time update effect
useEffect(() => {
  const timeInterval = setInterval(() => {
    setCurrentTime(new Date());
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(timeInterval);
}, []);
```

**Result**: Time now updates every second and displays in real-time.

### 2. **POS Icon Inconsistency** ✅

**Problem**: The POS icon was different between the sidebar and the Sales page.

**Root Cause**: Different icons were being used in different components.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Standardized on `ShoppingCart` icon from Lucide React
- Updated the Sales page header to use the same icon as the sidebar
- Ensured consistent icon usage across all POS-related components

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Sales page header now uses ShoppingCart icon (same as sidebar)
<div className="p-3 bg-blue-600 rounded-xl shadow-lg">
  <ShoppingCart className="w-8 h-8 text-white" />
</div>
```

**Result**: Consistent `ShoppingCart` icon used throughout the application.

## Additional Improvements Made

### 3. **Enhanced Time Display** ✅

**Improvements**:
- Added monospace font for better time readability
- Improved time formatting
- Better visual hierarchy

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
<span className="font-mono text-sm">{currentTime.toLocaleTimeString()}</span>
```

### 4. **Improved Dependencies** ✅

**Enhancement**: Fixed useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensure proper cleanup.

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added proper dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  // ... initialization code
}, [currentUser, currentSession]);
```
